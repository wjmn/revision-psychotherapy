* Introduction

Objective of this lecture is to /introduce/ some treatment tools to your toolkit.

We will briefly cover the treatments in your matrix, including:

1. Biological therapies (medications + interventional)
2. Psychotherapy

Tips:
1. Practise *active* recall. You will not remember this information passively!
2. See as much in real life as possible.
3. Review and repeat, it's super easy to forget details.

* Biological Therapies
:PROPERTIES:

Typically affect *neurotransmitters* in the brain:

| Agonist         | Mimics the neurotransmitter at the receptor: ↑                                            |
| Antagonist      | Blocks the neurotransmitter at the receptor: ↓                                            |
| Partial agonist | Mimics the neurotransmitter at the receptor when neurotransmitter concentrations are low. |

** Neurotransmitters
:PROPERTIES:

[[./notebooks/graphics/transmitters.svg]]

- Neurotransmitters are released by neurons in the brain into synapses, where
  other neurons can pick them up through receptors.

Some groupings:

- Monoamines :: Comprises *serotonin*, *noradrenaline* and *dopamine*. (SAD, if
     you remember it's NORadrenaline and not adrenaline!)


*** Serotonin (aka 5-HT)

Seven families of receptors.

| Receptor | Association                                                      |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 5HT_1    | Migraine, pain. (agonists are anti-migraine e.g. sumatriptan)    |
| 5HT_2    | Weight gain.                                                     |
| 5HT_3    | Nausea, vomiting. (antagonists are antiemetics e.g. ondansetron) |
| 5HT_4    | GI motility (agoists are prokinetic e.g. cisapride).             |
| 5HT_5    | ?                                                                |
| 5HT_6    | ?                                                                |
| 5HT_7    | Thermoregulation, circadian rhythm, cognition.                   |

*** Dopamine

There are *four* main dopamine pathways in the brain.

| Nigrostriatal      | SN           | Dorsal striatum       | Movement        | ↓ ⇒ PD                             |

| Tuberoinfundibular | Hypothalamus | Pituitary stalk       | "Don't lactate" | ↓ ⇒ galactorrhoea                  |

SN = substantia nigra, PD = Parkinson's disease, VTA = ventral tegmental area

#+HTML: </div>

There are *five* dopamine receptors (D_1 to D_5), distributed throughout the
pathways at varying concentrations.

*D_2* is the main target of antipsychotics.

*** Noradrenaline

*** Acetylcholine

*** Histamine

|        |                                                   |

Functions:
- Sleep/arousal
- Feeding and appetite
- (In the periphery) - allergy

Four receptors:

| Receptor | Association                                                                                  |

| H_1      | Sedation, vertigo (caused by blockade e.g. from clozapine, doxepin, or even diphenhydramine) |
| H_2      | ? in CNS (antagonists not crossing BBB e.g. ranitidine used for peptic ulcer disease)        |
| H_3      | Sediation? (inverse agonist maybe for narcolepsy, pitolisant)                                |
| H_4      | Mostly peripheral.                                                                           |

*** Glutamate
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: slide
:END:

- Dominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain
- Receptors
  - NMDA
  - AMPA
  - KA

*** GABA
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: slide
:END:

- Dominant inhibitory neurotransitterin the brain

Relevance:
- Alcohol enhances GABA and reduces NMDA ⇒ anxiolytic effects
- Alcohol abuse causes compensatory decrease in GABA receptors and increase in
  NMDA receptors ⇒ hyperexcitable state, continuously dulled by alcohol
- When alcohol is withdrawn, suddenly no dulling ⇒ hyperexcitable state
  manifests as /delirium tremens/


** Antidepressants

[[./notebooks/graphics/antidepressants.svg]]

*** TCAs
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: slide
:END:

[[./notebooks/graphics/tca.svg]]

- Tricyclic antidepressants
- Severe or melancholic depression
- Block ALL the monoamines, AND anticholinergic and antihistaminergic


AE
- Anticholinergic effects (things stop flowing)
- Orthostatic hypotension
- Sexual dysfunction
- Weight gain
- Sedation
- QRS prolongation (so baseline ECG before starting a TCA)
-

*** MAOIs

- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors
- Slows down breakdown of monoamines (serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine)
-

*** SSRIs
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: slide
:END:

[[./notebooks/graphics/ssri.svg]]

- *Selective* serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
- *First line* pharmacological treatment of depression (with SNRIs and
  mirtazepine)
- Assess response after *2-4* weeks (it can take time!)


AE:
- Bleeding (reduces serotonin uptake in platelets) - so beware with NSAID,
  anticoagulants etc.
- Hyponatraemia (beware hot weather, diuretics, impaired renal function)
- Agitation
- Nausea, anorexia, diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort
- Insomnia (maybe less so if given in the morning)
- Orthostatic hypotension
- Sedation
- Sexual dysfunction
- Weight gain


Some easy heuristics:

- Fluoxetine is the SSRI of choice for teenagers. ::
-


** Mood stabilisers
*** Lithium

- Measure lithium concentrations 8-12 hours after last dose
- Therapeutic levels 0.6-0.8mmol/L
- Renal excretion
- Prior to starting: asess kidney, thyroid and parathyroid
- WHen stable, measure serum lithium every 3-6 months
- Measure renal function every 3-6 months
- Monitor thyroid function every 6-12 months
- Monitor calcium every 12 months (PTH if calcium is raised)

AE: GAIT
- Gastrointestinal
- Ataxia
- Impaired gait
- Fine tremor
- Hypothyroidism
- Diabetes insipidus
- Memory impairment/cognitive difficulties

*** Valproate
*** Lamotrigine

- Beware Steven's Johnson's syndrome

*** Carbemazapine
** Antipsychotics
** Sedatives
** Neurostimulation
* Psychological
